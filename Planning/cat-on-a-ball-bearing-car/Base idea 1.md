One idea is a top down view, so its like a crazy taxi kind of thing.
A good concept, is that ball bearing cars are normally only propelled by gravity, so we can have marked slopes and boosters in a procedural generated map, and you have to deliver some item while on it. Now what does the player do? Well they should drive (As in giving direction) the car and also try to keep impulse by using the previously mentioned mechanics, if the player runs out of impulse, they loose. They have 2 stats: max distance and max Items delivered.  

## About the map.

Yes it can be a grid in order to be generated easily, however, there may be bigger tiles (in whole numbers), which can be probably generated and fitted easily. This makes it so that there may be roundabouts, complex plazas with obstacles, and maybe even parked cars.

## About the car

The car should be finicky to drive but feel good. So i'm thinking of how one moves the shopping car when one is a kid, when turning, the car moves its back wheels sideways too, and this makes for a satisfying "drift" like effect. This should be easier than a normal turn, however it should be exaggerated, with the back moving rapidly so that it looks intentional.

## About the gameplay
You drive the car with the intention to deliver packages to different locations you should see with some sort of crazy taxi-like signaling, and should have a counter of impulse, with more impulse, you should go slightly faster (For dramatic effect), but not too fast or you would be too busy hitting things.
