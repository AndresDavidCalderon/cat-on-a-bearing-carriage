One idea is a top down view, so its like a crazy taxi kind of thing.
A good concept, is that ball bearing cars are normally only propelled by gravity, so we can have marked slopes and boosters in a procedural generated map, and you have to deliver some item while on it. Now what does the player do? Well they should drive (As in giving direction) the car and also try to keep impulse by using the previously mentioned mechanics, if the player runs out of impulse, they loose. They have 2 stats: max distance and max Items delivered.  

## About the map.

Yes it can be a grid in order to be generated easily, however, there may be bigger tiles (in whole numbers), which can be probably generated and fitted easily. This makes it so that there may be roundabouts,
