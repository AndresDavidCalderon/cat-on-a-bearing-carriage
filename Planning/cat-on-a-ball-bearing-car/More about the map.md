I need a small map to test things out. A good setup would be to have some sort of little maybe 3x3 grid neighbourhoods where the player really has to drift, the main park which neighbourhoods encompass, separated by a bit of farming land, with a lonely and hard to navigate road, so not a lot of desitions, but make it hard. 

Again, taking Colombian roads and villages would be a great creativity source.
