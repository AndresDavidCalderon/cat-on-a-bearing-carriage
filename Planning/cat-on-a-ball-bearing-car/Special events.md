On the day end and day start dialogues a linear calendar should appear with at most 1 event each day.

On order of priority:
- Night time delivery: Each 6th day people rest, most people use this to host nightly meetings with family, and milk must be in stock. However it should be delivered with care, as hitting too many things would wake people up if they are asleep. (Breaks should be given these days.)
