The game is quite fun as is, so I should prepare the Intro for the game to explain your objective and tilesets for the map.

The new idea is that the player is a cat in the town of jardin, with the task of delivering milk each morning to the people there so that they get it fresh. Cats don't know about adresses, but don't worry, people will call you. 

The intro goes like this:
- In the village of Jardin, people like their milk fresh, so someone has to deliver it each morning. (Art of you with the car appear)
- Cats don't know about adresses, but dont worry, people will help you out. When you deliver to someone, somone else will call you! (Artwork of delivery shows)

(Jardin was used as a placeholder) The actual village is Monteluna, a village based on the real life houses of Guatapé, the roads of Jardín and the landscape of Concepción.

First we will need to model the cat. Next we need a design for the car, both can be done in krita, actual assets should be made in aseprite.

How would the cat drift the car? I imagine through some sort of lever in the cubicle.
