The chiva should serve the industrial area from day 3. It should appear on a random point of the first 1/2 of the time (If it does or not is a random bool). It should enter from one of the town gates (Opens before entering) , which should not be trespassable for the cat. A dense fog should appear when he gets near not letting him out. After entering it should do the necessary turns to get to a random one of the 2 warehouses and stop there. Eventually there should be workers that pick stuff up and get it inside the warehouses and the chiva should leave.

The chiva should stop when finding the player up front, However wont flinch when the player hits it. This is how most cars should operate.
